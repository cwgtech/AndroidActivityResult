# AndroidActivityResult

This modifies our ShareScreenShot plugin to use a child activity to call the IntentChooser and wait for a result before then passing that result to our C# callback.

Using a child activity means we don't have to extend the standard Unity Player activity which can have a negative impact on other plugins.
